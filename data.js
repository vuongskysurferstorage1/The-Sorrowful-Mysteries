The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</div><div><br></div><div>He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”</div><div><br></div><div>When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</div><div><br></div><div>Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting?
